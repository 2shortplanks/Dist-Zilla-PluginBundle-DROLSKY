# NAME

Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::DROLSKY - DROLSKY's plugin bundle

# VERSION

version 0.70

# DESCRIPTION

This is the [Dist::Zilla](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla) plugin bundle I use for my distributions. Don't use
this directly for your own distributions, but you may find it useful as a
source of ideas for building your own bundle.

# SUPPORT

Bugs may be submitted through [the RT bug tracker](http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-DROLSKY)
(or [bug-dist-zilla-pluginbundle-drolsky@rt.cpan.org](mailto:bug-dist-zilla-pluginbundle-drolsky@rt.cpan.org)).

I am also usually active on IRC as 'drolsky' on `irc://irc.perl.org`.

# DONATIONS

If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
consider making a "donation" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time
creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care to offer.

Please note that **I am not suggesting that you must do this** in order for me
to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to do so,
inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.

Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this
software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can consider working
on free software full time (let's all have a chuckle at that together).

To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org, or use the
button at [http://www.urth.org/~autarch/fs-donation.html](http://www.urth.org/~autarch/fs-donation.html).
